<h3>A constructive approach to Henselization with applications</h3>
<h4>Mariemi Alonso (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)</h4>
<p align="justify">We discuss the construction of the  Henselization of a local ring from the point of view of &ldquo;constructive mathematics&rdquo;, in the line of the work of Richman, Coquand, and Lombardi. We focus  on the  multivariate Hensel lemma and  on the representation of algebraic power series,  which are   usually obtained as a consequence of ZMT,  both of them  not totally clear  from &ldquo;constructive point of view&rdquo;, although they are crucial results in the theory. Our constructive approach: concrete statements of the hypothesis  and algorithmic arguments  allows us to discover a new result, namely  "a  local Bezout  theorem" for abstract henselian rings.</p><p align="justify">
This talk is based on different results obtained together  with Henri Lombardi, Thierry  Coquand, Paco Castro and Herwig Hauser.</p>

<h3>On the number of real roots of random polynomial systems</h3>
<h4>Diego Armentano (Universidad de la Rep&uacute;blica)</h4>
<p align="justify">The roots of random polynomials and of random polynomial systems have been extensively
studied in the past. While the picture is quite complete in the case of polynomials, the case
of systems is much harder. Kostlan, Shub and Smale random polynomial systems were
introduced in the nineties and the expectation of the number of their real roots is known
since then. In this talk we will review some recent results on this problem.</p>

<h3>The square root of the dimension</h3>
<h4>Carlos Beltr&aacute;n (Universidad de Cantabria)</h4>
<p align="justify">...where a gorgeous result by Felipe Cucker is revisited, the solution to a famous problem is shown, and a theorem that is not a theorem is proved to be useful, but not necessarily in that order.</p>

<h3>Towards a Conscious AI: A Computer Architecture inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience</h3>
<h4>Lenore and Manuel Blum (Carnegie Mellon University)</h4>
<p align="justify">Thanks to major advances in cognitive neuroscience, we are on the brink of a scientific understanding of how the brain achieves consciousness.   This talk will describe cognitive neuroscientist Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Model (GWM) of the brain, its implications for understanding consciousness, and a novel computer architecture that it inspires.   
The major contribution of this talk lies in the precise formal model of a Conscious Turing Machine (CTM) aka a Conscious AI (CAI) to be presented.</p><p align="justify">
This is joint work with Avrim Blum. </p>

<h3>Making Artists and Mathematicians Work Together</h3>
<h4>Jean Pierre Bourguignon (IHÉS)</h4>
<p align="justify">In this talk I will present a few instances where it has been possible
to get artists and mathematicians to contribute to public events based
on interactions between them.</p>

<h3>Efficient algorithms for moment polytopes and the null cone problem from invariant theory</h3>
<h4>Peter B&uuml;rgisser (Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h4>
<p align="justify">Suppose a reductive group \(G\) acts linearly on a finite dimensional complex vector space \(V\). The corresponding null cone, which may be thought of the set of &ldquo;singular objects&rdquo;, consists of those vectors that cannot be distinguished from the zero vector by means of polynomial invariants. The null cone was introduced by Hilbert in his seminal work on invariant theory around 1900.</p><p align="justify">Quite surprisingly, the computational problem of testing membership to the null cone turned out to be of relevance for geometric complexity theory, quantum information theory, and other areas. Notably, a thorough study of the null cone for the simultanous left/right action on tuples of matrices was crucial for finding a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for verifying algebraic identies.</p><p align="justify">Despite the algebraic nature of the problem, numerical optimization algorithms seem to be the most efficient general methods for solving the null cone problem. This also applies to the related problem of testing membership to moment polytopes, which e.g., generalizes Horn's problem on the eigenvalues of sums of matrices.</p><p align="justify">The long term goal is to find polynomial time algorithms for these problems. In the special case of abelian groups, such algorithms are provided by linear programming, e.g. by interior methods. Condition numbers are likely to play an important role in this endeavour.</p>

<h3>How much patience do you have? (A story about the complexity of nonconvex optimization)</h3>
<h4>Coralia Cartis (University of Oxford)</h4>
<p align="justify">
We give an overview of results regarding the global evaluation complexity of local nonconvex optimization, focusing on two antipodal algorithmic cases. In particular, we discuss high-order regularisation methods that use higher order derivative information and can certify higher order criticality, and that have better complexity and universal properties. We then consider an inexact, probabilistic setting, where derivatives and even function evaluations may only be sufficiently accurate occasionally, but whose worst-case expected complexity can still be quantified. A story of robust methods emerges, with continuously-varying, often sharp and sometimes even optimal, complexity.

<!--<h3>Nonlinear Korn inequalities on a surface</h3>
<h4>Philippe Ciarlet (City University of Hong Kong)</h4>
<p align="justify">
It is well known that a surface can be recovered from its two fundamental forms if they satisfy the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi compatibility equations on a simply-connected domain, in which case the surface is uniquely determined up to isometric equivalence.</p><p align="justify">
It is less known that in this case the surface becomes a continuous function of its fundamental forms, again up to isometric equivalence, for various topologies, such as the Fr&eacute;chet topology of continuously differentiable functions, or those corresponding to various Sobolev norms.</p><p align="justify">
In this talk, we will review such continuity results obtained during the past fifteen years, with special emphasis on those that can be derived by means of nonlinear Korn inequalities on a surface.We will also mention potential applications of such results, such as the intrinsic approach to nonlinear shell theory, where the unknowns are the fundamental forms of the deformed middle surface of a shell.

<h3>Active learning: a weighted least-squares approach</h3>
<h4>Albert Cohen (Sorbonne Université)</h4>
<p align="justify">
In statistical learning, the regression problem refers to the search of a function u which best explains an output y from an input $x$, when the joint distribution of $(x,y)$ is unknown and a finite sample of this distribution is available. This setting was explored in depth in the seminal paper by Cucker and Smale. Active learning refers in contrast to the setting where the user has the possibility of choosing the values of the input and query the output. This is the case in many applications such as  sensing physical systems, or building response surfaces from numerical codes. In this talk, we review recent results on active learning based on weighted least-squares, which in particular reveal the existence of optimal  sampling  strategies.
</p>

<h3>Reconstructing random points from geometric graphs</h3>
<h4>Josep Diaz (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya)</h4>
<p align="justify">(Joint work with Colin McDiarmid and Dieter Mitsche)</p><p align="justify">
Suppose that there is a family of \(n\) random points independently and uniformly distributed in the square with area \(n\).  We do not see these points, but learn about them in one of the following two ways:</p><p align="justify">
Suppose first that we are given the corresponding random geometric graph G, where distinct vertices \(u\) and \(v\) are adjacent when their Euclidean distance is at most \(r\).  Assume that the threshold distance \(r\) satisfies certain conditions with respect to \(n\).  We shall see that the following holds with high probability:  Given the graph \(G\) (without any geometric information), in polynomial time we can approximately reconstruct the hidden embedding, in the sense that, 'up to symmetries', for each vertex \(v\) we find an embedding with 'displacement' at most \(r\).</p><p align="justify">
Now suppose that, instead of being given the graph \(G\), we are given, for each vertex \(v\), the ordering of the other vertices by increasing Euclidean distance from \(v\). Then, with high probability, in polynomial time we can find an embedding with the much smaller displacement error.

<h3>Optimal Descartes rule of signs for polynomial systems supported on circuits</h3>
<h4>Alicia Dickenstein (Universidad de Buenos Aires)</h4>
<p align="justify">Descartes rule of signs for univariate real polynomials is a beautifully simple upper bound for the number of positive real roots. Moreover, it gives the exact number of positive real roots when the polynomial is real rooted, for instance, for characteristic polynomials of symmetric matrices. A general multivariate Descartes rule is certainly more complex and still elusive.  I will recall the few known multivariate cases and will present a new optimal Descartes rule for polynomials supported on circuits, obtained in collaboration with Frédéric Bihan and Jens Forsgård.
</p>

<h3>Faithfully quadratic rings</h3>
<h4>Max Dickmann (Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche)</h4>
<p align="justify">I'll describe an extension of the classical algebraic theory of quadratic from fields to a broad class of rings. This extension applies to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>&ndash;Commutative, unitary rings where 2 is invertible, endowed with a proper preorder
(in particular, \(-1\) is not a sum of squares).</li>
<li>&ndash;Diagonal forms with invertible coefficients.
</ul>
<p align="justify">It is achieved by: (i) Suitably extending the notion of matrix isometry of quadratic forms, and (ii) Introducing three axioms expressing simple properties of the representation of ring elements by quadratic forms, known to hold in the field case.</p><p align="justify">
Under these axioms the ring-theoretic approach based on this extended notion of isometry coincides with the formal, abstract approach formulated in terms of reduced special groups. Preordered rings \(\langle A, T \rangle\) satisfying these axioms are called \(T\)-faithfully quadratic. This class includes (among others):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>&ndash;Rings with many units satisfying a mild restriction (for all preorders \(T\)).</li>
<li>&ndash;Reduced \(f\)-rings (for any preorder \(T\) containing the underlying partial order of \(A\)).<br/>
An outstanding class of examples of this type are the rings of continuous real-valued functions on a topological space.</li>
<li>&ndash;Bounded-inversion preordered rings \(\langle A, T \rangle\) with an Archimedean preorder \(T\).</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
Most of the structural properties involving quadratic forms known to hold for fields extend to \((T)\)-faithfully quadratic rings. Joint work with F. Miraglia (Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil).

<h3>On Perfect Quadrature Formulas</h3>
<h4>Ujué Etayo (TU Graz)</h4>
<p align="justify">We refer to collections of points and weights where the points belong
to a compact Riemannian manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) and the weights are positive real
numbers. We say that such collections are a perfect quadrature
formulae if we can compute exactly the integral of any function \(f\) (\(f\)
belonging to a space of diffusion polynomials) on the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) by
computing the weighted sum of \(f\) evaluated on the points.
We will show how obtaining such sets of points for fixed weights is an
extremely challenging problem and nevertheless, their existence can be
proved using rather simple tools.
During this talk, we will review some recent results on this problem.</p>

<h3>On Bohemian Correlation Matrices</h3>
<h4>Laureano Gonzalez Vega (Universidad de Cantabria)</h4>
<p align="justify">Bohemian matrices are families of matrices whose entries come from a fixed discrete set of small integers. A symmetric matrix is a correlation matrix if it has ones on the diagonal and its eigenvalues are nonnegative. We will show that the number of Bohemian Correlation Matrices over \(0\) and \(1\) are linked with Bell numbers (<a href="https://oeis.org/A000110">OEIS A000110</a>) and will introduce a new characterisation of correlation matrices in order to analyse what happens with these numbers when the entries come from \(-1\), \(0\) and \(1\) and to solve some correlation matrix completion problems arising in risk management and insurance.

<h3>Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Fewnomials, \(\tau\)-Conjecture in Tropical Algebra</h3>
<h4>Dima Grigoriev (CNRS)</h4>
<p align="justify">Tropical analogs of the combinatorial Nullstellensatz, universal testing set for fewnomials and \(\tau\)-conjecture are provided.
</p>

<!--<h3>Stochastic Gradient Descent and Perceptron Boundedness</h3>
<h4>Raphael Hauser (University of Oxford)</h4>
<p align="justify">The development of stochastic gradient descent type algorithms (SGD) have been a major factor in allowing optimisation methods to be successfully applied to ever larger data analytics and machine learning problems. In applications it is often observed that if SGD is stopped early rather than being left to complete its calculations to a high accuracy termination criterion, the resulting solutions are of greater practical relevance. In this talk we will shed some light on this phenomenon, by relating the problem of minimising objective functions in the form of a sum of simple functions to the maximum feasible subsystem problem and perceptron boundedness, the latter being characterised by a condition number. Under this interpretation, early stopping of SGD yields solutions to a robust version of the underlying optimisation problem.</p>-->


<h3>Fast approximation on the real line</h3>
<h4>Arieh Iserles (University of Cambridge)</h4>
<p align="justify">While approximation theory in an interval is thoroughly understood, the real line represents something of a mystery. In this talk we review the state of the art in this area, commencing from the familiar Hermite functions and moving to recent results  characterising all orthonormal sets on \(L_2(-\infty,\infty)\) that have a skew-symmetric (or skew-Hermitian) tridiagonal differentiation matrix and such that their first \(n\) expansion coefficients can be calculated in \(O(n \log n)\) operations. In particular, we describe the generalised Malmquist–Takenaka system. The talk concludes with a (too!) long list of open problems and challenges.
</p>

<h3>The adjoint of a polytope</h3>
<h4>Kathlén Kohn (Universitetet i Oslo)</h4>
<p align="justify">This talk brings many areas together: discrete geometry, statistics, intersection theory, classical algebraic geometry, and geometric modeling. First, we recall the definition of the adjoint of a polytope given by Warren in 1996 in the context of geometric modeling. He defined this polynomial to generalize barycentric coordinates from simplices to arbitrary polytopes. Secondly, we show how this polynomial appears in statistics. It is the numerator of a generating function over all moments of the uniform probability distribution on a polytope. Thirdly, we prove the conjecture that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree which vanishes on the non-faces of a simple polytope. In addition, we see that the adjoint appears as the central piece in Segre classes of monomial schemes. Finally, we observe that adjoints of polytopes are special cases of the classical notion of adjoints of divisors. Since the adjoint of a simple polytope is unique, the corresponding divisors have unique canonical curves. In the case of three-dimensional polytopes, we show that these divisors are either \(K3\)- or elliptic surfaces.

<h3>The incredible shrinking algebraic computation model</h3>
<h4>Pascal Koiran (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon)</h4>
<p align="justify">In the 1957 movie &ldquo;the incredible shrinking man&rdquo;, a businessman is exposed to radioactive dust and begins to shrink while researchers try and fail to stop that process. In this talk we will see what happens if, instead of a human being, we shrink the computation model that the researchers study.
</p>

<h3>A local analysis</h3>
<h4>Teresa Krick (Universidad de Buenos Aires / CONICET)</h4>
<p align="justify">We introduce a notion of local analysis meant to capture the behavior of conic condition numbers around a point. This is inspired on the concept of smoothed analysis introduced some years ago by Spielman and Teng, which takes as cost the supremum of the average on small balls around points. Here we are interested in studying directly the average on small balls around points, without considering the supremum on the whole space.</p><p align="justify">
This is joint work with Felipe Cucker.
</p>

<h3>The complexity of solving numerically black-box polynomial systems</h3>
<h4>Pierre Lairez (Inria)</h4>
<p align="justify">Research on Smale's 17th problem succeeded in designing polynomial average time algorithms for
computing numerically one root of a polynomial system. The input size of the polynomial size
(with respect to which is measured the complexity) is the number of monomials in the dense
representation of the system. It is an enormous number, exponential in both the dimension and
the degree of the system.</p><p align="justify">Now, if the system is given as a black-box evaluation program, what can we say about the complexity of computing one root?</p>

<h3>Wilkinson's bus: Weak condition numbers, with an application to singular polynomial eigenproblems</h3>
<h4>Martin Lotz (Warwick University)</h4>
<p align="justify">We propose a new approach to the theory of conditioning for numerical analysis problems for which both classical and stochastic perturbation theory fail to predict the observed accuracy of computed solutions. As motivation, we present examples of problems that are discontinuous at a given input and have infinite classical and stochastic condition number, but where the solution is still computed to machine precision without relying on structured algorithms. Stimulated by the failure of classical and stochastic perturbation theory in capturing such phenomena, we define and analyse a weak worst-case and a weak stochastic condition number. This new theory is a more powerful predictor of the accuracy of computations.
</p>

<h3>A theory of \(\mathsf{NP}\)-completeness and ill-conditioning for approximate real computations</h3>
<h4>Gregorio Malajovich (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro)</h4>
<p align="justify">We propose a complexity theory for approximate real computations. The aim is to extend the BSS
theory to allow for condition numbers and for approximate real computations. This is done in two
steps, and I plan to explain the first one (BSS theory with exact computations and condition
numbers). This will address recent criticisms of the BSS theory as inadequate for describing fractal
objects and other morally easy decision problems.</p><p align="justify">
The input size depends on a condition number, which is not assumed known by the machine. This
theory admits deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial time recognizable problems. We
prove that \(\mathsf{P}\) is not \(\mathsf{NP}\) in this theory if and only if \(\mathsf{P}\) is not \(\mathsf{NP}\) in the BSS theory over the reals.</p><p align="justify">
If time allows, I will outline the theory with approximate computations. This theory also admits
classes \(\mathsf{P}\) and \(\mathsf{NP}\) and also an \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete problem. The \(\mathsf{P}\) vs \(\mathsf{NP}\) question in this new theory is
related (but not known to be equivalent) to the classical \(\mathsf{P}\) vs \(\mathsf{NP}\) problem.<br>
This is joint work with Mike Shub.

<h3>Logic and Computation: Felipe's Work on Descriptive Complexity</h3>
<h4>Klaus Meer (BTU Cottbus)</h4>
<p align="justify">There is a long and fruitful interplay between the fields of
logic and computation. One of its examples is the field of descriptive
complexity. Among the many fields in which Felipe Cucker worked (and works)
descriptive complexity has been one.
In this talk we want to review some of the results in this area
with particular emphasis on joint work done many years ago with Felipe Cucker.
</p>

<h3>Affine Weyl Groups and Multivariate Polynomial Interpolation</h3>
<h4>Hans Munthe-Kaas (University of Bergen)</h4>
<p align="justify">What is the complexity of multivariate polynomial computations such as polynomial multiplication, derivation and integration?</p><p align="justify">
In 1-D, interpolation in Chebyshev nodes enjoy the optimal logarithmic Lebesgue constant and allow the computation of polynomial multiplication, derivation and quadrature via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In 2D, Padua points are known to be unisolvent (just enough points to represent all bivariate polynomials up to given order uniquely), and they also enjoy optimal Lebesgue numbers.</p><p align="justify">
We will in this talk discuss another set of unisolvent points for multivariate polynomial interpolation in any dimension, again with optimal Lebesgue numbers and they allow for fast (\(N \log N\)) computations of multiplication, derivation and quadrature via FFT and recursions. The points are based on the theory of Weyl groups and root lattices, an area of mathematics which originates from the representation theory of Lie groups. </p><p align="justify">
It sounds like a perfect computational device, but we will discuss some issues which so-far has limited the practical use of these interpolation points. 
</p>

<h3>The Hoffman constant of a system of linear inequalities</h3>
<h4>Javier Pe&ntilde;a (Carnegie Mellon)</h4>
<p align="justify">A classical result of Alan Hoffman from 1952 shows that if a point
almost satisfies a system of linear inequalities, then it is near an
actual solution to the system of linear inequalities. We provide a
novel characterization of the sharpest Hoffman constant associated to
this "almost implies near" relationship. Our characterization extends
to the more general case when some inequalities are easy to satisfy as
in the case of box constraints. Our characterization also yields a
procedure to compute the Hoffman constant &ndash; a notoriously difficult and
largely unexplored computational challenge.</p>

<h3>The Convex Feasibility Problem</h3>
<h4>James Renegar (Cornell University)</h4>
<p align="justify">Given a finite collection of convex sets for each of which an interior point is known, we present an
elementary algorithm for computing a point in the intersection, and bound the algorithm’s
complexity in terms of a natural condition number.</p>

<h3>Children, Trees, and Point Counting Over Prime Power Rings</h3>
<h4>Maurice Rojas (Texas A&M University)</h4>
<p align="justify">We begin with a very short story about how Felipe Cucker and Steve
Smale helped Maurice meet a Brasilian historian in Barcelona. We then see
an efficient reduction of point counting for hypersurfaces over \(\mathbb{Z}/(p^k)\) to
point counting over prime fields, generalizing earlier work of Cheng, Dwiwedi, Gao,
Mittal, Saxena, and Wan. This leads to a new, much simpler proof of the rationality of
Igusa zeta functions. The latter zeta functions are related to p-adic integration (thanks to
work of Igusa and Denef) and an unusual class of pseudorandom generators (due to Anshel
and Goldfeld). This is joint work with Caleb Robelle and Yuyu Zhu.</p>

<h3>Faces of convex sets: dimensions and regularity</h3>
<h4>Vera Roshchina (UNSW Sydney)</h4>
<p align="justify">The facial structure of convex sets can be surprisingly complex, and unexpected irregularities of the arrangements of faces give rise to badly behaved sets and various counterexamples. I will focus on specific properties that capture irregularities (dimensions of faces, singularity degree, facial exposure and facial dual completeness) and will introduce some constructive conditions that can be used to detect irregular facial arrangements.</p><p align="justify">
This talk is based on joint work with Prof. Levent Tun&ccedil;el, University of Waterloo.
</p>

<h3>Quantative Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</h3>
<h4>Marie-Francoise Roy (University of Rennes 1)</h4>
<p align="justify">Using subresultants, we modify a recent real-algebraic proof due to Eisermann of the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ([FTA]) to obtain the following quantitative information:
in order to prove the [FTA] for polynomials of degree d, the Intermediate Value Theorem
([IVT]) is requested to hold for real polynomials of degree at most d^2. We also explain
that the classical proof due to Laplace requires [IVT] for real polynomials of exponential
degree. These quantitative results highlight the difference in nature of these two proofs. 
See arXiv:1803.04358v3.</p><p align="justify">
This is joint wok with Danel Perrucci.</p>

<h3>Bifurcations and Condition Numbers</h3>
<h4>Mike Shub (City College of New York)</h4>
<p align="justify">In part one I will describe the pitchfork bifurcation from an index centered approach. This is joint work with Pujals and Yang generalizing the approach of Smale and Rajapakse.</p><p align="justify">
In part two I will discuss a complexity theory of decision problems in exact arithmetic whose input size depends on the condition number as well as the dimension. The polynomial class will only need to output yes for the set and will not need to terminate on the complement. This approach relates to the approaches of Braverman-Yampolsky and Cucker and Smale. It is joint work with Gregorio Malajovich.

<h3>Models for the heart beat</h3>
<h4>Steve Smale (Berkeley)</h4>
<p align="justify">Certain cells in the heart called myocytes put into a petri dish will oscillate individually until they become close together when they start to beat in unison.  The mathematics goes  back more than 350 years  with Huygens and is still trying to give a good picture.  I have been working with Indika Rajapakse and Charles Pugh on these things and we have been led to a fascinating complex of problems and insights into the  dynamics of the heart beat.</p>

<h3>The zero set of the independence polynomial of a graph</h3>
<h4>Mart&iacute;n Sombra (ICREA & Universitat de Barcelona)</h4>
<p align="justify">In statistical mechanics, the independence polynomial of a graph arises as the partition function of the hard-core lattice gas model. The distribution of the zeros of these polynomials at the thermodynamic limit is expected to be relevant for the study of the model and, in particular, for the determination of its phase transitions.
In this talk, I will review the known results on the location of these zeros, with emphasis on the case of rooted regular trees of fixed degree and varying depth. Our main result states that for these graphs, the zero sets of their independence polynomials converge as the depth increases towards the bifurcation measure of a certain family of dynamical systems on the Riemann sphere.</p><p align="justify">
This is ongoing work with Juan Rivera-Letelier (Rochester)
</p>

<h3>Average minus Weak Complexity equals Adaptive algorithms</h3>
<h4>Josu&eacute; Tonelli-Cueto (Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h4>
<p align="justify">In 1999 Felipe Cucker introduced the real global condition number, fondly known as \(\kappa\) (kappa), in his seminal paper "Approximate zeros and condition numbers". This condition number and its variations are widely believed to capture the numerical complexity of problems in real algebraic geometry. In this talk, we show that this is not the case and that a new condition-based approach might open the door to finite expectation algorithms in numerical real algebraic geometry.
</p>

<h3>Algebraic complexity measures versus geometric complexity measures for convex optimization</h3>
<h4>Levent Tun&ccedil;el (University of Waterloo)</h4>
<p align="justify">We will discuss algebraic and geometric condition numbers in a context of complexity analysis
of algorithms for convex optimization. Goffin-Cheung-Cucker measure of convex cones will come
up during the talk.
</p>

<h3>Classification of triangulated monotone families in dimension 3</h3>
<h4>Nicolai Vorobjov (University of Bath)</h4>
<p align="justify">In a variety of topological problems about sets, definable in o-minimal structures over the reals (e.g., semialgebraic or subanalytic sets), approximations of sets by monotone definable families turn out to be useful. In the presence of blow-ups, such a family can exhibit a complex behaviour. Hence, it is desirable to classify monotone families into a finite number of standard types. In the talk I will describe a triangulation of an ambient definable set of a family in dimension 3, such that, in each 3-simplex, the family belongs to one of nine types, corresponding to nine possible lexicographically monotone Boolean functions in three variables.</p><p align="justify">Joint work with S. Basu and A. Gabrielov.

<h3>Towards High Approximation Methods for the SVD in the General Case</h3>
<h4>Jean-Claude Yakoubsohn (Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse)</h4>
<p align="justify">The extension of the Shub-Smale theory to systems with multiple zeroes is proposed in the book &ldquo;Condition &ndash; The Geometry of Numerical Algorithm&rdquo; as an open problem.  We propose such a study restricted to the singular value decomposition problem in the case where there are clusters of singular values.
